## What is Semente?

**Semente** (Portuguese for *seed*) is a multi-agent AI chat framework for land
use and agriculture. It was extracted from
[Pasto Legal](https://github.com/lapig-ufg/pasto-legal) (LAPIG/UFG) — an AI
assistant that delivers satellite-based pasture diagnostics to Brazilian
ranchers over WhatsApp.

Semente keeps the domain-neutral engine and lets you grow a new assistant by
supplying a **domain**: the tools, knowledge base, skills, and prompts that make
your app specific.

> *Pasto Legal was the first seed.*

## How it works

```
User (WhatsApp / Streamlit)
        │
        ▼
   Semente workflow
   ├── Input step (media → text)
   ├── PII guardrail
   ├── Onboarding check (terms)
   ├── Parallel: summarization + feedback loop + your agent
   ├── Remediation merge
   └── Output step (TTS)
        │
        ▼
   Your domain (tools, knowledge, skills, prompts)
```

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install semente-agents
```

```python
from semente.build import build_app

app = build_app("semente.yaml")  # FastAPI app (WhatsApp webhook)
```
