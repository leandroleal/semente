"""Assemble a Semente application from a manifest.

The single entry point: loads the manifest, applies the prompts dir, imports
the domain, builds the agent + workflow, and wires the channels. The domain is
imported *inside* this function (after the prompts dir is set) so that
domain tools loading prompts at import time resolve correctly.

No Agno ``AgentOS`` — the FastAPI app is assembled directly and the WhatsApp
router is mounted on it.
